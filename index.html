    <h1> Lost In The Star </h1>
    <p>Made by Tania Kelly in 2021</p>
    <p> This sketch, inspired by Annapurna Interactive's video game, Outer Wilds, represents a journey into space, an impossible adventure, and a fleeting dream. With audio samples taken from nasa.gov website, orbiting planets and neighboring stars, I wanted to create an exciting experience. I have never been very interested in the space theme and have never been into coding either. This year was the year that I went beyond my boundaries, searching for the unknown and the uncertain, and it feels like an outer space joy. This sketch represents my new journey, exploring the new opportunities that are coming my way.</p>
